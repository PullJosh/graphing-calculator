# Josh's Graphing Calculator

My goal is to make this the most _addictive_ graphing calculator possible. Anyone who uses it should be instantly hooked.

## Addictive Features

- [ ] Create 3D graphs and fly around inside them
- [x] Create vibrant color maps in 2D
- [ ] Create vector fields in 1D, 2D, and 3D, and watch little objects/particles follow the vector path
- [ ] Create stunning screenshots and movies of your graphs
- [ ] Click and drag on a number in an equation to quickly adjust it and watch the graph respond in real time

## How to market?

Writing code is fun, but what I really need to do is get the calculator in front of people and be useful to them.

I am terrible at marketing, so learning how to do this is my #1 priority.

I don't spend very much time on social media, but I at least watch a fair bit of YouTube, so I know the culture there, which means I might be able to make something that feels like a fit on the platform.

Watching people write code is pretty boring, but if you can get a clear visual of how the code behind the graphing calculator works, that's pretty cool.

**The YouTube videos are the product.** Only spend coding time on features that will make for a good video. (This happens to contribute to the virality goal quite nicely. It will actually encourage me to build all the right features.)

I need to make YouTube videos _that people will want to watch_; not necessarily the videos that I want to create.
