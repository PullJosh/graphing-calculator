# Representing 1D, 2D, and 3D geometry

|     | Boundary (=) | Volume (> or <)                                                                                                |
| --- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1D  | 1D points    | 1D segments                                                                                                    |
| 2D  | 2D segments  | 2D triangles                                                                                                   |
| 3D  | 3D triangles | 3D volumes (represented in THREE.js as hollow surfaces made of triangles, but conceptually are filled volumes) |
